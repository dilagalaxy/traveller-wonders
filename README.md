This is dila. I am a girl who dream big and put a vision in her mind trying to take a step closer to it. I love the idea of working on things you love. Also having freedom of time and freedom of adventure to explore to different part of the world. Also, getting knowledge and learn something you once wouldnt know. My app would show you how you could get happiness, freedom and steps to take to make dreams become into reality to be a digital nomad.
You could explore, work and learn at the same time. Attractive ey! Ranging for luxury to budget travels you could get it done all in one. Saving money, working and also having fun is my main goal.
